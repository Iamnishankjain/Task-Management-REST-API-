# Task-Management-REST-API-
TaskManager API is a simple RESTful web service built using Java Spring Boot for managing tasks. It allows users to create, view, and manage tasks with attributes like title, description, and status. The backend uses an in-memory H2 database and follows a clean, modular architecture with Spring Data JPA and standard CRUD operations.
